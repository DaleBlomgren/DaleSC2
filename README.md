# DaleSC2
Starcraft 2 machine learning project

Basic bot for Starcraft II that "learns" the more replays you feed to it.  This project uses the pysc2 deepmind python library to
simulate Starcraft matches on any os.  Over time, you should see the bot make more scvs, build infastructure and control marines to greater effect.
